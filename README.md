four-elements
=============

code for the first part of the http://cabbibo.com. Not really meant to be public code, because I was still in the process of learning javascript while creating it. Basically all it does is allows the user to click around the page creating different rings of rectangles, and then allows the user to spin this image, which creates an optical illusion.
